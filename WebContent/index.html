<div><p style="font-family: charter; margin-right:1000px">Baby Bonnie Hood (B.B. Hood) or "Bulleta", as she is sometimes known (real name pending) is one of the most terrifying figures in Darkstalkers' world-- for humans and monsters, alike. But, nothing about her-- on the outside-- would indicate such a thing. Her attire is (intentionally) reminiscient of that of Red Riding Hood, and she exudes a fitting innocence-- she speaks quietly and sweetly, she skips about without a care in the world, has quite the juvenile stature... and, of course, the little dog certainly helps.</p></div>
<div><p style="font-family: charter; margin-left: 1000px; margin-bottom: 50px;">But, at the same time, she's a murderous psychopath. Her sheer, selfish malevolence strikes fear even into the hearts of monsters-- especially those she hunts, mostly for the sake of money, the only thing that she seems to value as much as herself (and that damn little dog).</p></div>
<div><p style="font-family: charter; margin-top: 50px">To achieve her selfish aims, BB can employ a variety of tools. Firstly, regardless of her normal(?) human constitution and unintimidating frame, she is capable of taking on high-ranking Darkstalkers blow for blow, has the agility to jump in mid-air without supernatural aid, and is able to effortlessly control the recoil of an automatic weapon firing at nearly 1000 rounds per minute. In addition to this, she's mastered the tactical use of her innocent facade, and is adept at concealing everything from large rifles to missile launchers within her hood. Even without her extreme monetary resources, her sheer malevolence may be enough to punch through magical defenses she encounters...</p></div>
