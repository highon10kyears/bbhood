<div><p style="font-family: charter; margin-right:1000px">Baby Bonnie Hood (B.B. Hood) or "Bulleta", as she is sometimes known (real name pending) is one of the most terrifying figures in Darkstalkers' world-- for humans and monsters, alike. But, nothing about her-- on the outside-- would indicate such a thing. Her attire is (intentionally) reminiscient of that of Red Riding Hood, and she exudes a fitting innocence-- she speaks quietly and sweetly, she skips about without a care in the world, has quite the juvenile stature... and, of course, the little dog certainly helps.</p></div>
